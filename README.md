## Repository Structure

This repository consists of two main folders: `Data` and `App`.

### `Data` Folder

The `Data` folder contains all the necessary data used in the app, along with the Python scripts that were utilized to generate this data from various space agency sources. These include:

- **ESA** and **Gaia DR3 Catalog**
- **Hipparcos Catalog** from the European Space Agency
- **Constellation Data** from **Stellarium**

The Python code processes this raw data to create the files used by the app for star and constellation visualization.

### `App` Folder

The `App` folder contains the Xcode project for the Exosky iOS app, written in **Swift**, utilizing **UIKit** and **SceneKit** to provide an interactive and visually immersive star-gazing experience.
